# GRADED FUNCTION: back_substitution

def back_substitution(M):
    """
    Perform back substitution on an augmented matrix (with unique solution) in reduced row echelon form to find the solution to the linear system.

    Parameters:
    - M (numpy.array): The augmented matrix in row echelon form with unitary pivots (n x n+1).

    Returns:
    numpy.array: The solution vector of the linear system.
